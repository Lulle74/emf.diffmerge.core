/**
 * A difference which represents the presence of an unmatched element.
 * 
 * - If the difference is merged as an addition of the element, i.e., the destination
 *   role is getPresenceRole().opposite(), then the element is copied and added to the
 *   destination scope. For performance reasons, references between added elements are
 *   not copied until completeReferences(destinationRole) is called on the mapping
 *   (IMapping) of the comparison. This is automatically done when merge(...) is called
 *   on the comparison with the updateReferences_p parameter set to true.
 * 
 * - If the difference is merged as a deletion of the element, i.e., the destination
 *   role is getPresenceRole(), then the element is removed from its scope. The exact
 *   semantics of the removal depends on the scope.
